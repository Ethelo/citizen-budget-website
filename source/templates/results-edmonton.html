                <p class="b-fancy-text">Renowned as a leader in municipal innovation, particularly for its communications and public outreach efforts, Edmonton implemented two highly successful Citizen Budget consultations in 2013 and 2014. In 2014 Edmonton achieved what might be (at least in Canada) a first - marrying a stand-alone online budget simulator (Citizen Budget) with an online engagement portal that proved highly successful in building and engaging a 3,000 person strong dedicated online community on the city budget.</p>

            <div class="b-half">
                <p>For its 2015 budget, Edmonton launched another comprehensive and creative online Citizen Budget exercise, this time independent of its online panel. Drawing on its strong community ties, developed both online and offline over many years, the city once again saw very high quality and quantity returns on its 3rd Citizen Budget consultation in as many years.</p>
