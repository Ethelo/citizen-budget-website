                <p class="b-fancy-text">For their 2012 budget, the borough of Plateau Mont-Royal in Montreal held Canadaâ€™s inaugural Citizen Budget online budget consultation for its lucky residents.

            <div class="b-half">
                <p>using sliders containing actual data from the city budget, Citizen Budget put Plateau residents through the paces of balancing the budget, much as city council and staff do.</p>
                <p>The online consultation reached more residents while costing 90% less than previous traditional consultations. After the consultation, the borough mayor, Luc Ferrandez, presented the local budget to the public and explained how citizens' input directly influenced the borough's decisions. </p>
