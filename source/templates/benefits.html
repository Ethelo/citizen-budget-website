            <h2>Benefits of Online Budget Consultation</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, governments have held public consultations to solicit feedback on budgets, laws and projects. While these processes are beneficial to the community, traditional consultations have significant limitations. A typical public consultation can be costly and stretch over many months. They are often poorly attended and can attract vocal groups with specific interests who may not represent the average citizen's needs. This is where digital tools come into play.</p>
            <p>Trends in Internet use are favorable to an online approach. With the vast majority of people now online, the trend towards online budget consultation has been gaining considerable momentum in North America and elsewhere.</p>
