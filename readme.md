# Citizen Budget Website

## Getting Started

Include the remote repositories:
`git remote add cb-en git@github.com:opennorth/citizen-budget-website.git`
`git remote add cb-fr git@github.com:opennorth/citizen-budget-website-fr.git`

Run `npm install` in the project directory, to install all the gulp dependencies

Run `gulp watch` to start task manager. Gulp should take care of mostly everything.

Run `gulp deploy` to push commits to github repositories.

NPM only manages the Gulp Dependencies. It is not used to manage the front-end dependencies.
